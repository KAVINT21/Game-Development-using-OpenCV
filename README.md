# Game-Development-using-OpenCV
I have developed 4 games in which we can control the game using hand tracking(OpenCV's Hand Tracking Module)


# Introduction

The main objective of this assignment is to help us understand the
concepts and apply AI techniques to a real word problem and prepare a
research report. The synchronization of our team made us choose the topic
of machine vision in the gaming industry. We have used python libraries
such as pygame, opencv, cv zone to develop the game. Nowdays, AR and
VR is used gaming industry. Therefore, in nearing future we can use
recognition of human features can enhance the level of gaming. In our
project, we have developed four games in which the controls of the game
can be handled by hands with use of web camera in the machine.

# Abstract


Machine vision technology can also be used in virtual reality (VR) and
augmented reality (AR) gaming. VR headsets use cameras and sensors to
track the player&#39;s head movements and adjust the game&#39;s perspective
accordingly. AR games, on the other hand, use cameras and sensors to
overlay virtual elements onto the player&#39;s real-world surroundings.
Overall, machine vision technology can greatly enhance the gaming
experience by making it more immersive and interactive. It can also open
up new possibilities for game design, allowing developers to create more
realistic and engaging games.
